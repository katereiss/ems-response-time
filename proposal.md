### **Question/need:**

The Fire Department of New York (FDNY) is interested in reducing ambulance response times for medical emergencies. This project aims to identify what types of medical emergencies, locations, responding stations, and other factors may contribute to delayed response times. 

### **Data Description:**

Dataset: [EMS Incident Dispatch Data]([https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/EMS-Incident-Dispatch-Data/76xm-jjuj](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/EMS-Incident-Dispatch-Data/76xm-jjuj)) from NYC OpenData provides a CSV dataset where one row is one EMS incident. There are 29 million rows, and I will use 10,000. Some of the 31 columns include incident datetime, call type, response time in seconds, and zip code. 

### **Tools:**

- Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets for exploratory data analysis
- Tableau for data visualization
- Pandas for initial EDA due to size of dataset

### **MVP Goal:**

An MVP for this project would include an impact hypothesis, solution path, measures of success, risks and assumptions, and one visualization of a single finding from EDA.
